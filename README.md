# Oracle and SQL Server Services Manager

## Overview

This Python script controls the Oracle SQL Developer and SQL Server services on a Windows PC. The script allows you to start and stop many services with a single command. This is especially critical when services, like Oracle SQL Developer, are always running and using a large amount of RAM, causing performance issues on lower-end computers. It is important to note that if you have not completely disabled the services from the start-up, notÂ via Task Manager, they will continue to run during boot.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this script is to:
- **Stop services** that may not be in use, freeing up system resources.
- **Start services** when they are needed again.

This script is especially helpful for those who find that Oracle SQL Developer services are taking up significant RAM even when not in active use.

## Features

- Start or stop all relevant Oracle and SQL Server services with a single command.
- Easy to use, command-line interface.
- Includes a standalone executable for users who may not have Python installed.

## Affected Services

This script will manage the following services:

- **Oracle SQL Developer Services:**
  - OracleJobSchedulerORCL
  - OracleOraDB19Home1MTSRecoveryService
  - OracleOraDB19Home1TNSListener
  - OracleRemExecServiceV2
  - OracleServiceORCL
  - OracleVssWriterORCL

- **SQL Server Services:**
  - SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)
  - SQL Server Browser
  - SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER01)
  - SQL Server CEIP service (MSSQLSERVER)
  - SQL Server CEIP service (MSSQLSERVER01)
  - SQL Server VSS Writer

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10**: This script is specifically designed for Windows 10.
- **Administrator Privileges**: The script must be run with administrative privileges to control services.

## How to Run

### Running from Python Script

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ronan-R-R/service-manager.git
    cd service-manager
    ```

2. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python manage_services.py
    ```

3. **Choose an action**:
    - Enter `start` to start all listed services.
    - Enter `stop` to stop all listed services.

### Running the Executable

1. **Locate the executable**:
    After building the executable (or using the pre-built one), locate `manage_services.exe` in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Run the executable as an administrator**:
    - Right-click the `.exe` file and select "Run as administrator".
    - Follow the prompts to start or stop the services.

## Warnings

- **Administrative Rights Required**: You must run the script or executable with administrative privileges. Failure to do so will result in errors when attempting to start or stop services.
- **Service Dependencies**: Be aware that stopping some services may affect dependent applications or services. Ensure that you understand which services you are stopping.
- **System Performance**: Stopping critical services may improve system performance but could also impact functionality. Use this script carefully and make sure to restart necessary services when required.
